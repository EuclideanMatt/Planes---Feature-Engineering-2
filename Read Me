Planes Feature Engineering #2 - Destinations & Routes

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs feature engineering on plane data from a SQL Server database. The focus is on deconstructing and encoding route, source, and destination features. The notebook demonstrates various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights and prepare the data for machine learning models.

Planes - Feature Engineering #2 - Destinations & Routes.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing the feature engineering process.
Key Features

SQL Integration: 
Connects to a SQL Server database and retrieves data from the flights_cleaned table.

Data Exploration: 
Provides an overview of the data, including unique values of the route, source, and destination features.

Feature Engineering:

Deconstructs the route feature into individual stops.

Creates dictionaries to numerically encode categorical features ensuring consistency across the dataset.

Encodes the source and destination features to match the encoded route stops.

Handles missing values in the encoded features.

Data Export: 

Saves the cleaned and engineered dataset back to the SQL Server database.
